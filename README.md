In this exam, i created Model class to manage the latitude and longitude.

I created ArrayList of type <Model> to add the markers and then send that arraylist through intent to map activity
  
On map activity i used forloop to get all the markers and adding each and every marker to map
   
In, OnSensor changed method i am moving the position of the camera to others markers.
